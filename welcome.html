            Welcome to my final project for <i>INT 200: Avenue 50 Studio Internship Academic Project</i>, 
            Spring Semester 2023. I'm excited to introduce you to this interactive learning experience, where you'll 
            explore my reserach on the art non-profit sector and my experience as a web intern. <br>**The underlined sections below will navigate you to that part of the page.

    <h2 id="section1">Project Description </h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          My project aims to analyze the current technology practices of Avenue 50 Studio and provide recommendations 
          for how the organization can improve its use of technology to better serve its community and support its 
          mission-driven work. The website serves as an important platform for the organization, and as a web editor intern, 
          I gained insight into the challenges and opportunities presented by technology for nonprofit arts organizations.
          <br>
          <br>
          The project will feature an overview of Avenue 50 Studio, an analysis of its current technology infrastructure and 
          practices, a literature review of technology in the nonprofit sector, a case study of The Laundromat Project, and 
          recommendations for Avenue 50 Studio and other arts organizations. By exploring these topics, my project will provide 
          a comprehensive overview of the role of technology in the nonprofit arts sector and offer practical strategies for 
          organizations to maximize their impact.

        This website has over 1,600 lines of code, using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is tailored to fit my creative vision, 
        using programming resources like Stack Overflow, Google, and ChatGPT as needed for advanced tech support. The code files and resources will be 
        available for viewing on my GitHub portfolio <a href="https://github.com/mcgrath-a/ave50internship" > click here</a>. GitHub is a web-based platform that facilitates version 
        control and collaboration, allowing users to manage and store revisions of their projects, including code files, 
        and share them with others. I hope that not only is my engagement with the 
        course material evident but you (the audience) are immersed in the website as I have spent many 
        hours making it tailored to my liking :)

    <h2 id="section2">Who and why </h2>

        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          The project is aimed at nonprofit arts organizations, technology professionals, and individuals interested in the 
          intersection of technology and the arts. By highlighting the importance of staying current with technology, adopting 
          effective content strategies, and exploring opportunities for collaboration between the arts and technology sectors, 
          this project aims to support the mission-driven work of nonprofits like Avenue 50 Studio and help them reach a wider audience.
          <br>
          <br>
          Through my research and analysis, I hope to provide actionable recommendations for nonprofits to improve their use of
           technology and maximize their impact. I also hope to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities presented by 
           technology for the nonprofit arts sector and inspire individuals to get involved in supporting these organizations.

          <h2 id="section4">Final Thoughts and Personal Takeaways:</h2>

          <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
            As a Computer Science Studies major, I found this project to be an engaging and enlightening experience.
             I enjoyed learning about the challenges faced by nonprofit arts organizations and the potential of 
             technology to support their work. If given more time, I would have liked to delve deeper into the 
             technical aspects of the website and implement a virtual exhibition to generate revenue for the 
             organization. Overall, I hope that my project provides valuable insights and recommendations for
              nonprofits in the arts sector and inspires individuals to get involved in supporting these important 
              organizations. I hope you enjoy exploring this timeline as much as I enjoyed creating it!
