            Spring Semester 2023. I'm excited to introduce you to this interactive learning experience, where you'll 
            explore key events and themes from our course. <br>**The underlined sections below will navigate you to that part of the page.

    <h2 id="section1">Project Description </h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
        My project is an interactive timeline, designed as a web-based application, focusing on 
        Unit 4: Europe and the World at War, covering events related to World War II and the Holocaust. 
        The inspiration for this project comes from our exploration of themes throughout HIST 122, such 
        as the rise of fascism, racism and antisemitism, the Nuremberg Laws, and the impact of black soldiers 
        in World War II. In addition to Unit 4, the timeline addresses the theme of "Silencing the Past," 
        demonstrating how false narratives continue to shape history and emphasizing the importance of dismantling 
        these misconceptions.The timeline will feature images, excerpts from course materials, and a unique analysis 
        of the events and informed opinions based on our discussions in class.  
        <br>
        </p>
    <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
        This website has over 1,600 lines of code, using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is tailored to fit my creative vision, 
        using programming resources like Stack Overflow, Google, and ChatGPT as needed for advanced tech support. The code files and resources will be 
        available for viewing on my GitHub portfolio <a href="https://github.com/mcgrath-a/HIST122FinalProject" > click here</a>. GitHub is a web-based platform that facilitates version 
        control and collaboration, allowing users to manage and store revisions of their projects, including code files, 
        and share them with others. I hope that not only is my engagement with the 
        course material evident but you (the audience) are immersed in the website as I have spent many 
        hours making it tailored to my liking :)

    <h2 id="section2">Who and why </h2>

        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
            The project aims to connect course themes, discussions, and methodology while offering a unique analysis of events based on our class discussions.
            By creating this interactive learning experience, I hope to provide students, educators, history enthusiasts, and individuals with a tool that allows 
            them to delve deeper into these historical events and gain a greater understanding of the complexities surrounding World War II and the Holocaust. 
            Through the use of True or False questions, my project aims to debunk common misconceptions and reveal the truth behind these pivotal moments in history, 
            highlighting the connections between course themes and showcasing the importance of accurate historical representation.

          <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
            Creating this project was a fun and educational experience. I enjoyed researching and diving deeper into specific 
            events, analyzing them based on our class discussions and lectures. As a Computer Science major, I found it rewarding 
            to apply my programming skills to a historical context, bringing these important events to life in an interactive and 
            engaging way. I hope you enjoy exploring this timeline as much as I enjoyed creating it!
