                <p>Technology has become increasingly vital in the nonprofit sector, enhancing the reach of organizations and transforming mission-driven work. According to the Pew Research Center (2013), 92% of nonprofits had a website, and 84% had a social media presence, showing a growing trend of technology adoption in the sector. This research project investigates the use of technology in nonprofit arts organizations, focusing on Avenue 50 Studio, a Latinx community arts nonprofit in Los Angeles.

                <p style="font-size:26px;font: weight 700px;;">Who is Avenue 50 Studio?</p>
                <p>Avenue 50 Studio is a nonprofit organization promoting Latinx artists and fostering intercultural understanding in Los Angeles. Its mission is to bridge cultures through artistic expression, using content-driven art to educate and stimulate intercultural understanding among the diversity of Los Angeles (Avenue 50 Studio). The organization faces various challenges, such as limited resources and the need to continually adapt to changing technologies, while serving a diverse community of artists, patrons, and local residents.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The organization aims to support Latinx artists and the community by providing exhibition spaces, workshops, and resources for artistic development. Avenue 50 Studio also plays a crucial role in the community by organizing events, offering educational opportunities, and addressing socioeconomic needs, such as hosting a community pantry and a vaccination site. By doing so, they strive to make a lasting impact on the community they serve.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Incorporating technology in their operations is vital for Avenue 50 Studio to effectively achieve their goals and overcome challenges. The Pew Research Center (2013) reports that 72% of nonprofits used the internet to engage with their audience, and 68% used it for fundraising purposes. Additionally, the study found that 59% of nonprofits used technology to collaborate with other organizations. These figures demonstrate the potential of technology in supporting the mission and goals of nonprofits like Avenue 50 Studio.

                </p>
              <p>
                Hackler and Saxton (2007) identified six key strategic organizational competencies essential for enhancing nonprofit IT capacity, emphasizing the need for support in utilizing and evaluating IT. They noted, "Nonprofits need to develop IT management, funding, and leadership capacity" (p. 433). These competencies can guide organizations like Avenue 50 Studio in the strategic use of technology, ensuring that they maximize the potential benefits of their IT investments.

               </p>
              <p>
                Raman (2016) investigated the adoption and effectiveness of SMAC technologies in nonprofit organizations, finding benefits in communication, mobility, and analytics, but cautioning against unsuitable cloud computing options. Raman states, "SMAC technologies can provide nonprofits with cost-effective and efficient solutions to support their mission-driven activities" (p. 107). This research suggests that Avenue 50 Studio should carefully consider the adoption of SMAC technologies to enhance their digital presence and operations while being mindful of potential drawbacks.

              <p>
                Guo and Saxton (2014) explored the role of technology and online presence in nonprofit advocacy, highlighting the potential of websites and social media in advocacy efforts and communication. They argue that "nonprofit organizations can leverage online tools to strengthen their advocacy capacity" (p. 56). Avenue 50 Studio can leverage these tools to strengthen its online presence and engage with its community, ensuring that its message reaches a wider audience.

               <p>
                Kapin and Sample Ward (2013) emphasized the importance of implementing online multichannel strategies for advocacy, fundraising, and community engagement, integrating both online and offline interactions for maximum impact. They suggest that "a successful multichannel approach requires a strategic combination of online and offline tactics" (p. 45). Adopting such strategies can help Avenue 50 Studio effectively reach and engage with its target audience, maximizing the potential of its digital platforms.

                </strong></p>
              <p>
                Alexander and Fernandez (2021) critically examine the state of the nonprofit sector in the wake of neoliberalism, discussing how marketization, professionalization, and government regulation have progressively altered nonprofits' capacities to engage the public. The authors suggest that these changes have required organizations to shift from community engagement to establishing organizational legitimacy with funders. However, Alexander and Fernandez also highlight opportunities for nonprofits to counteract these trends by fostering community connections, engaging in deliberative democracy, and ensuring their boards and staff are representatives of the communities they serve. These insights can guide Avenue 50 Studio in navigating the broader socio-economic context, aligning its technology strategies with its commitment to community engagement and representation.

                </strong></p>
              <p>
                The Laundromat Project, a nonprofit arts organization based in New York City, has successfully utilized technology to engage its community, promote its mission, and support its programs (The Laundromat Project). The organization focuses on connecting artists with local communities and creating socially relevant art projects in public spaces, including laundromats, which parallels Avenue 50 Studio's mission of fostering intercultural understanding through artistic expression.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of The Laundromat Project's successful strategies includes using social media to highlight community art projects, amplify the voices of local artists, and engage with a diverse audience. They have also effectively integrated their online and offline efforts, using digital tools to complement and enhance their community-based initiatives.
                <br>
                <br>
                To remediate gaps in their technology infrastructure, The Laundromat Project has implemented an online fundraising platform, streamlined their website, and developed a comprehensive digital communications plan. These strategies have significantly improved their online presence and helped them reach a wider audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                By learning from The Laundromat Project's strategies, Avenue 50 Studio can enhance its use of technology to further its mission and better serve its community. This could involve adopting similar social media strategies, improving their website design and functionality, and implementing a comprehensive digital communication plan to better engage with their target audience and promote their programs.

                As we delve deeper into the operational aspects of Avenue 50 Studio, it is crucial to understand its current technology infrastructure and practices.

                </strong></p>
              <p>
                While serving as a web editor intern at Avenue 50 Studio getting the opportunity through the Occidental's OxyArts organization, during my time I played an instrumental role in managing the WordPress website, and concurrently worked on developing innovative, cost-free solutions for generating video captions. This initiative significantly improved the accessibility of the gallery's digital content. The necessity of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of WordPress was indispensable in order for me to effectively administer the site. Avenue 50 Studio's website (Avenue50studio.org) is vital to their operations, particularly in the area of grant writing, as it serves as a platform for grant reviewers to assess certain criteria.Furthermore, I was able to enhance the website by implementing an automatic API integration update feature for the weekly newsletters, ensuring that visitors are always presented with the most recent edition.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, despite these improvements, the website still has identifiable areas of weakness in terms of its design and functionality. These shortcomings, I believe, can be traced back to the organization's nonprofit status and the relative lack of advanced technical expertise among the staff. While the staff is proficient in their respective roles, they lack the specialized knowledge of a dedicated IT team, which could potentially limit the website's capacity to engage and inform its audience in a more effective manner.
                <br>
                <br>
                In fact, the indispensable Ms. Kathy, due to the staffing shortage, is often tasked with an array of secretarial duties in addition to running the business. This situation further highlights the need for comprehensive documentation and training materials on the WordPress site, a task I would have gladly undertaken given more time. It would have ensured a smoother transfer of duties and understanding of the website's operations among the staff.By recognizing these areas for improvement, and understanding their underlying causes, we can strategize and work towards optimizing Avenue 50 Studio's online presence.
